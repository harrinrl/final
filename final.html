<h1>Laws restricting women's access to reproductive health care increase unintended pregnancies</h1>
<h2>States with laws limiting abortion or contraception access is linked to higher unintended pregnancy rates</h2>

<h3><p>Unintended pregnancies by state
<h4>"Unintended" is a mistimed or unwanted pregnancy that resulted in a birth or an abortion</h4></p>
<div class = "map"></div>

<div class = "legend"></div>
	<span class="five">36-39 percent</span>
	<span class="six">40-46 percent</span>
	<span class="seven">47-53 percent</span>
	<span class="eight">54-62 percent</span>

<h5>Source: <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-Unintended-Pregnancy-US.html#box">Guttmacher Institute</a></h5>	
	
<div class = "article"><p>
    More than half of pregnancies across the U.S. are unintended. This means they were either mistimed (31 percent) or unwanted (20 percent) and resulted in a
birth (60 percent) or an abortion (40 percent). Each year, this results in 3.4 million pregnancies that were unintentional. This data comes from the    <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/about/index.html">Guttmacher Institute</a>, an organization that tracks and supports reproductive health rights, which
    gathered the information based on state survey programs or a mathematical model (Arizona, District of Columbia, Indiana, Kansas, Nevada, New Hampshire and
    South Dakota, Montana and North Dakota). This number is surprisingly high, so what's driving unintended pregnancy rates?
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.nwlc.org/profile/kelli-garcia">Kelli Garcia</a>, senior counsel for the National Women's Law Center, said the biggest factors increasing the number of unintended pregnancies are
    contraception education and access. The Affordable Care Act improved access to free birth control since it requires insurance programs cover contraception.
    Public funding of contraception has been shown to have an effect on pregnancy rates, Garcia said, since cost can be a significant barrier to obtaining
    birth control. Since the 1980s, unintended pregnancies have become concentrated among low-income women, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Garcia said
    the full effects of the ACA haven't trickled down yet, so it may take a few years before unintended pregnancy rates decrease because of the increased
    access to contraception.
</p>
<p>
    Abstinence-only education has also been shown to drive unintended pregnancy rates up, Garcia said. During the month of conception that resulted in an
    unintended pregnancy, 54 percent of women said they did not use birth control at all, and 41 percent said they had used it inconsistently. "Everyone needs
    to be taught how to protect themselves in order to prevent unintended pregnancies," Garcia said.
</p>
<p>
    For women who find themselves pregnant when they don't want to be, access to abortions and emergency contraception can be imperative to their health and
    finances, and the health and economics of society as a whole. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that unintended pregnancies cost the government alone $21
    billion in 2010. So how do these laws stack up state-by-state?

    Garcia said the National Women's Law Center would like to see all of the policies here change to "meets." Required waiting periods and biased counseling
    periods in particular, she said, are unnecessary burdens to getting abortions that shame women and make it harder to take care of their health. "Policies
    that restrict access to health care send a message that politicians don't trust women to make their own decisions about their health care."
